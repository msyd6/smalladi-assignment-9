### Analysis of Activation Functions in Neural Networks

Below are the analyses for the given activation functions based on their behavior in learned features, decision boundaries, and gradients visualization.

##### Learned Features in Hidden Space
- **Tanh**:
  - Points are well-distributed and clearly separated, leading to better decision-making capability.
  - The smooth transitions in the plane suggest efficient handling of negative and positive gradient flows.
- **ReLU**:
  - Data points are unevenly spread, with some sharp separations between the points in the hidden space.
  - Clustering of certain data points indicates inactive neurons resulting from zero gradients.
- **Sigmoid**:
  - Shows more clustering of data points with a less defined decision boundary.
  - Limited capability for complex feature separation.

##### Decision Boundary in Input Space
- **Tanh**:
  - Decision boundaries are non-linear and smoothly conform to the data distribution.
- **ReLU**:
  - Sharp and angular decision boundaries, with some overfitting to sharp data shifts.
- **Sigmoid**:
  - Simple, linear boundary. Limited capability to adapt to data complexity.

##### Gradients Visualization
- **Tanh**:
  - Well-balanced gradient flow. No extreme saturation or inactivity observed.
- **ReLU**:
  - Gradients are strong in active neurons but show inactive units with zero gradients.
- **Sigmoid**:
  - Gradients are weaker across all connections. Learning is generally slower due to small updates.

##### Convergence Behavior
- **Tanh**: Balanced convergence, good for non-linear separations.
- **ReLU**: Fast convergence, can lead to uneven learning due to dead neurons.
- **Sigmoid**: Struggles with vanishing gradients, slow learning, difficulty in forming complex decision regions.
