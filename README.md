### Analysis of Activation Functions in Feedforward Neural Networks for GitHub README

Below are the analyses for the given activation functions (`tanh`, `relu`, and `sigmoid`) based on their behavior in learned features, decision boundaries, and gradients visualization.

#### 1. First Set of GIFs (Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh)

##### Learned Features in Hidden Space
- **Sigmoid**:
  - The hidden space shows a concentration of data points that are less spread compared to other activation functions.
  - The decision plane appears flat, suggesting that the network struggles with forming complex decision regions.
  - Blue and red data points are clustered closely together, indicating a poor differentiation capability.
- **ReLU**:
  - The points are distinctly separated, and the hidden space contains clear clusters.
  - Sharp changes in the plane suggest effective modeling of non-linearity, but some inactive neurons can cause certain regions to appear clustered near zero.
- **Tanh**:
  - Data points are well-distributed in the hidden space, with a balance between positive and negative outputs.
  - The smoother separation of blue and red points indicates that `tanh` can effectively spread data in the feature space.

##### Decision Boundary in Input Space
- **Sigmoid**:
  - The decision boundary is linear and not very adaptive, which can struggle to separate complex data distributions.
- **ReLU**:
  - Produces sharp, angular boundaries. Can be highly non-linear, fitting data accurately, but prone to overfitting.
- **Tanh**:
  - Provides a well-contoured, non-linear decision boundary.
  - The smooth boundary adapts effectively to the data.

##### Gradients Visualization
- **Sigmoid**:
  - Gradients are weaker due to saturation, leading to ineffective learning.
  - Gradient lines are mostly thin, indicating slow convergence.
- **ReLU**:
  - Some connections have strong gradients, while others may become inactive, leading to dead neurons.
  - Varying thickness in connections suggests an imbalance in learning across neurons.
- **Tanh**:
  - Balanced gradient propagation, which prevents extreme saturation or neuron inactivity.
  - Gradients maintain medium strength throughout, aiding effective learning.

##### Convergence Behavior
- **Sigmoid**: Slow convergence, linear decision boundaries, struggles with complex data.
- **ReLU**: Fast convergence, able to learn complex boundaries, but risk of dead neurons.
- **Tanh**: Balanced convergence, effective for non-linearity while avoiding vanishing gradient issues.

#### 2. Second Set of GIFs (Tanh, ReLU, Sigmoid)

##### Learned Features in Hidden Space
- **Tanh**:
  - Points are well-distributed and clearly separated, leading to better decision-making capability.
  - The smooth transitions in the plane suggest efficient handling of negative and positive gradient flows.
- **ReLU**:
  - Data points are unevenly spread, with some sharp separations between the points in the hidden space.
  - Clustering of certain data points indicates inactive neurons resulting from zero gradients.
- **Sigmoid**:
  - Shows more clustering of data points with a less defined decision boundary.
  - Limited capability for complex feature separation.

##### Decision Boundary in Input Space
- **Tanh**:
  - Decision boundaries are non-linear and smoothly conform to the data distribution.
- **ReLU**:
  - Sharp and angular decision boundaries, with some overfitting to sharp data shifts.
- **Sigmoid**:
  - Simple, linear boundary. Limited capability to adapt to data complexity.

##### Gradients Visualization
- **Tanh**:
  - Well-balanced gradient flow. No extreme saturation or inactivity observed.
- **ReLU**:
  - Gradients are strong in active neurons but show inactive units with zero gradients.
- **Sigmoid**:
  - Gradients are weaker across all connections. Learning is generally slower due to small updates.

##### Convergence Behavior
- **Tanh**: Balanced convergence, good for non-linear separations.
- **ReLU**: Fast convergence, can lead to uneven learning due to dead neurons.
- **Sigmoid**: Struggles with vanishing gradients, slow learning, difficulty in forming complex decision regions.
